                    		<li>
                    			Although BoozAid cannot fully shield you against over-indulging from time to time, you can shield yourself against the worst effects of alcohol by taking 2-4 capsules of BoozAid with 8 oz of water before bedtime.

	                    			<strong>Milk Thistle</strong> has been used for over two thousand years due to its remarkable cleansing and support of the liver. Research has proven that thistle helps with:
									
									<ul>
										<li>
											- The detoxification of poisons—such as alcohol
										</li>

										<li>
											- The regeneration of damaged liver tissue
										</li>

										<li>

	                    			<strong>Oriental Raisin Tree</strong> , one of the most powerful substances in BoozAid, is harvested from the Holvenia Dulcis plant. In Asia, for over a thousand years, this plant has been used to brew a special tea that aids in the discomfort that results from a night of partying. Only recently has the active ingredient, Dihydromyricetin (a natural plant flavonoid), been isolated and extracted from the the Oriental Raisin Tree.

	                    			<strong>B Vitamins / Thiamine NAC</strong> is thought to work even better when combined with thiamine (also known as vitamin B6). Vitamin B6 may also help lessen hangover symptoms. Since alcohol depletes vitamin B in the body, and B vitamins are required to help eliminate alcohol from the body, a B-vitamin supplement should be taken beforehand, as well as the next day.
