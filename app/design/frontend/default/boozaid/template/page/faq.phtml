									<p>
										Milk Thistle has been used for over two thousand years due to its remarkable cleansing and support of the liver. Research has proven that thistle helps with:
									</p>

									<ul>
										<li>The detoxification of poisons—such as alcohol</li>
										<li>The regeneration of damaged liver tissue</li>
										<li>Improved digestion</li>
									</ul>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>Oriental Raisin Tree</strong> , one of the most powerful substances in BoozAid, is harvested from the Holvenia Dulcis plant. In Asia, for over a thousand years, this plant has been used to brew a special tea that aids in the discomfort that results from a night of partying. Only recently has the active ingredient, Dihydromyricetin (a natural plant flavonoid), been isolated and extracted from the the Oriental Raisin Tree.
									</p>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>B Vitamins / Thiamine NAC</strong> is thought to work even better when combined with thiamine (also known as vitamin B6). Vitamin B6 may also help lessen hangover symptoms. Since alcohol depletes vitamin B in the body, and B vitamins are required to help eliminate alcohol from the body, a B-vitamin supplement should be taken beforehand, as well as the next day.
									</p>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>Glutamine</strong> Ingesting glutamine will help to minimize reaction known asglutamine rebound. Alcohol inhibits glutamine, a natural stimulant in your body. This is partly why alcohol has a depressive effect that may make you fall asleep easily.
									</p>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>Magnesium</strong>, Another nutrient depleted by alcohol, and it’s one in which many are already deficient. Plus, magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties that may help to reduce certain hangover symptoms such as pounding headache.
									</p>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>Acerole Berry</strong> Extract is very high in vitamins A and C. It also contains thiamine and riboflavin, which are known to be natural energy boosters.
									</p>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>Bupleurum Root Powder</strong> Ingesting glutamine will help to minimize reaction known as glutamine rebound. Has been known to combat fatigue, headaches, insomnia and depression. It also assists in protecting the liver.
									</p>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>Artichoke Leaf Powder (Cilarin)</strong> is ideal for hangovers as it decreases nausea and vomiting.
									</p>
											 
									<p>
										<strong>Kudzu Powder</strong> is beneficial in boosting the metabolism and detoxifying. Studies have also shown that kudzu can curb the craving for alcohol and lessen symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
